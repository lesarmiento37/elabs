# Split Checks
## The Problem
The startup FairPay wants to build an application so that restaurant waiters can split checks
more easily. Currently, the waiter needs to ask every single person in the table how much of the
check each member of the table they want to pay.
## The solution
FairPay will simplify this by providing a functionality to know, in realtime, each of the ordered
products to a specific table member so that when the check is generated it already knows who
pays what.
